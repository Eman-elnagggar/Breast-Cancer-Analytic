# 🧠 Breast Cancer Analytics

This project involves analyzing two different breast cancer datasets to extract insights, explore features, and build a classification model for tumor diagnosis.

## 📁 Datasets Used

### 1. [SEER Breast Cancer Data](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/seer-breast-cancer-data) (from IEEE)
- Focuses on diagnostic information of women with **malignant breast cancer**.
- Includes both **patient data** (age, race, etc.) and **tumor data** (size, stage, etc.).
- 📌 **Goal**: Analyze general information about women diagnosed with the disease.
- ✅ **Tasks Done**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Handling missing values and outliers
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations

### 2. [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data) (from Kaggle)
- Focuses on **tumor characteristics**.
- 📌 **Goal**: Study tumor features to classify them as **malignant** or **benign**.
- ✅ **Tasks Done**:
  - Feature correlation analysis
  - Data preparation and normalization
  - Applied classification algorithms
  - Achieved **97% accuracy** using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Machine Learning (SVM, train-test split, feature scaling)

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Understand and explore breast cancer-related datasets
- Perform data cleaning and visualization to extract meaningful insights
- Build a high-accuracy classification model for tumor diagnosis

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Demographics and patterns in breast cancer diagnostics among women
- Feature importance and correlation in predicting malignancy
- Visualization of tumor characteristics using plots and heatmaps

## 🚀 Results
- Successfully prepared and visualized both datasets
- Built a classification model with **97% accuracy** using SVM
- Identified key tumor features contributing to diagnosis
